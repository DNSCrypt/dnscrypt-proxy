* Version 2.0.27
 - The X25519 implementation was changed from using the Go standard
implementation to using Cloudflare's CIRCL library. Unfortunately,
CIRCL appears to be broken on big-endian systems. That change has been
reverted.

* Version 2.0.26
 - A new plugin was added to prevent Firefox from bypassing the system
DNS settings.
 - New configuration parameter to set how to respond to blocked
queries: `blocked_query_response`. Responses can now be empty record
sets, REFUSED response codes, or predefined IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.
 - The `refused_code_in_responses` and `blocked_query_response` options
have been folded into a new `blocked_query_response` option.
 - The fallback resolver is now accessed using TCP if `force_tcp` has
been set to `true`.
 - CPU usage when enabling DNSCrypt ephemeral keys has been reduced.
 - New command-line option: `-show-certs` to print DoH certificate
hashes.
 - Solaris packages are now provided.
 - DoH servers on a non-standard port, with stamps that don't include
IP addresses, and without working system resolvers can now be properly
bootstrapped.
 - A new option, `query_meta`, is now available to add optional records
to client queries.

* Version 2.0.25
 - The example IP address for network probes didn't work on Windows.
The example configuration file has been updated and the fallback
resolver IP is now used when no netprobe address has been configured.

* Version 2.0.24
 - The query log now includes the time it took to complete the
transaction, the name of the resolver that sent the response and if
the response was served from the cache. Thanks to Ferdinand Holzer for
his help!
 - The list of resolvers, sorted by latency, is now printed after all
the resolvers have been probed.
 - The "fastest" load-balancing strategy has been renamed to "first".
 - On Windows, a nul byte is sent to the netprobe address. This is
required to check for connectivity on this platform. Thanks to Mathias
Berchtold.
 - The Malwaredomainlist URL was updated to directly parse the host
list. Thanks to Encrypted.Town.
 - The Python script to generate lists of blacklisted domains is now
compatible both with Python 2 and Python 3. Thanks to Simon R.
 - A warning is now displayed for DoH is requested but the server
doesn't speak HTTP/2.
 - A crash with loaded-balanced sets of cloaked names was fixed.
Thanks to @inkblotadmirer for the report.
 - Resolvers are now tried in random order to avoid favoring the first
ones at startup.

* Version 2.0.23
 - Binaries for FreeBSD/armv7 are now available.
 - .onion servers are now automatically ignored if Tor routing is not
enabled.
 - Caching of server addresses has been improved, especially when
using proxies.
 - DNSCrypt communications are now automatically forced to using TCP
when a SOCKS proxy has been set up.

* Version 2.0.22
 - The previous version had issues with the .org TLD when used in
conjunction with dnsmasq. This has been fixed.

* Version 2.0.21
 - The change to run the Windows service as `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`
has been reverted, as it was reported to break logging (Windows only).

* Version 2.0.20
 - Startup is now *way* faster, especially when using DoH servers.
 - A new action: `CLOAK` is logged when queries are being cloaked.
 - A cloaking rule can now map to multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
with load-balancing.
 - New option: `refused_code_in_responses` to return (or not) a
`REFUSED` code on blacklisted queries. This is disabled by default, in
order to work around a bug in Android Pie.
 - Time-based restrictions are now properly handled in the
generate-domains-blacklist.py script.
 - Other improvements have been made to the `generate-domains-blacklist.py`
script.
 - The Windows service is now installed as `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`.

* Version 2.0.19
 - The value for `netprobe_timeout` was read from the command-line, but
not from the configuration file any more. This is a regression introduced
in the previous version, that has been fixed.
 - The default value for netprobe timeouts has been raised to 60 seconds.
 - A hash of the body is added to query parameters when sending DoH
queries with the POST method in order to work around badly configured
proxies.

* Version 2.0.18
 - Official builds now support TLS 1.3.
 - The timeout for the initial connectivity check can now be set from
the command line.
 - An `Accept:` header is now always sent with `GET` queries.
 - BOMs are now ignored in configuration files.
 - In addition to SOCKS, HTTP and HTTPS proxies are now supported for
DoH servers.

* Version 2.0.17
 - Go >= 1.11 is now supported
 - The flipside is that Windows XP is not supported any more :(
 - When dropping privileges, there is no supervisor process any more.
 - DNS options used to be cleared from DNS queries, with the exception
of flags and payload sizes. This is not the case any more.
 - DoH queries are smaller, since workarounds are not required any more
after Google updated their implementation.

* Version 2.0.16
 - On Unix-like systems, the server can run as an unprivileged user,
and the main process will automatically restart if an error occurs.
 - pledge() on OpenBSD.
 - New "offline" mode to serve queries locally without contacting any
upstream servers. This can be especially useful along with the
cloaking module for local development.
 - New logo.
 - TTL of OPT records is properly ignored by the caching module.
 - The proxy doesn't quit any more if new TCP connections cannot be
created.

* Version 2.0.15
 - Support for proxies (HTTP/SOCKS) was added. All it takes to route
all TCP queries to Tor is add `proxy = "socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"` to
the configuration file.
 - Querylog files have a new record indicating the outcome of each
transaction.
 - Pre-built binaries for Linux are statically linked on all
architectures.

* Version 2.0.14
 - Supports DNS-over-HTTPS draft 08.
 - Netprobes don't use port 0 by default, as this causes issues with
Little Snitch and FreeBSD.

* Version 2.0.13
 - This version fixes a crash when using DoH for queries whose size
were a multiple of the block size. Reported by @char101, thanks!

* Version 2.0.12
 - Further compatibility fixes for Alpine Linux/i386 and Android/i386
have been made. Thanks to @aead for his help!
 - The proxy will now wait for network connectivity before starting.
This is useful if the proxy is automatically started at boot, possibly
before the network is fully configured.
 - The IPv6 blocking module now returns synthetic SOA records to
improve compatibility with downstream resolvers and stub resolvers.

* Version 2.0.11
 - This release fixes a long-standing bug that caused the proxy to
block or crash when Position-Independent Executables were produced.
This bug only showed up when compiled on (not for) Alpine Linux and
Android, for some CPU architectures.
 - New configuration settings: cache_neg_min_ttl and
cache_neg_max_ttl, to clamp the negative caching TTL.

* Version 2.0.10
 - This version fixes a crash when an incomplete size is sent by a
local client for a query over TCP.
 - Slight performance improvement of DNSCrypt on non-Intel CPUs such
as Raspberry Pi.

* Version 2.0.9
 - Whitelists have been implemented: one a name matches a pattern in
the whitelist, rules from the name-based and IP-based blacklists will
be bypassed. Whitelists support the same patterns as blacklists, as
well as time-based rules, so that some website can be normally
blocked, but accessible on specific days or times of the day.
 - Lists are now faster to load, and large lists require significantly
less memory than before.
 - New options have been added to disable TLS session tickets as well
as use a specific cipher suite. See the example configuration file for
a recommended configuration to speed up DoH servers on ARM such as
Android devices and Raspberry Pi.
 - The `-service install` command now remembers what the current
directory was when the service was installed, in order to later load
configuration files with relative paths.
 - DoH: The "Cache-Control: max-age" header is now ignored.
 - Patterns can now be prefixed with `=` to do exact matching:
`=example.com` matches `example.com` but will not match `www.example.com`.
 - Patterns are now fully supported by the cloaking module.
 - A new option was added to use a specific cipher suite instead of
the server's provided one. Using RSA+ChaChaPoly over ECDSA+AES-GCM has
shown to decrease CPU usage and latency when connecting to Cloudflare,
especially on Mips and ARM systems.
 - The ephemeral keys mode of dnscrypt-proxy v1.x was reimplemented: this
creates a new unique key for every single query.

* Version 2.0.8
 - Multiple URLs can be defined for a source in order to improve
resiliency when servers are temporarily unreachable.
 - Connections over IPv6 will be preferred over IPv4 for DoH servers
when using a fallback resolver if `ipv6_servers` is set.
 - Improvements have been made to the example systemd configuration
files.
 - The chacha20 implementation was updated to possibly fix a bug on
Android/x86.
 - `generate-domains-blacklist.py` can now parse dnsmasq-style rules.
 - FreeBSD/arm builds have been added.
 - `dnscrypt-proxy -list -json` and `-list-all -json` now include the
remove servers names and IP addresses.

* Version 2.0.7
 - Bug fix: optional ports were not properly parsed with IPv6
addresses -- thanks to @bleeee for the report and fix.
 - Bug fix: truncate TCP queries to the prefixed length.
 - Certificates are force-refreshed after a time jump (e.g. when a
system resumes from hibernation).

* Version 2.0.6
 - Automatic log files rotation was finally implemented.
 - A new -pidfile command-line option to write the PID file was added.

* Version 2.0.5
 - Fixes a crash occasionally happening when using DoH servers, with
stamps not containing any IP addresses, a DNSSEC-signed name, a
non-working system DNS configuration, and a fallback server supporting
DNSSEC.

* Version 2.0.4
 - Fixes a regression with truncated packets. Thanks to @mazesy and
@the-w1nd for spotting a case triggering this!

* Version 2.0.3
 - Load balancing: resolvers that respond promptly, but with bogus
responses are now gradually removed from the preferred pool.
 - Due to popular request, Android binaries are now available! Thanks
to @sporif for his help on getting these built.
 - Binaries are built using Go 1.10-final.

* Version 2.0.2
 - Properly error out on FreeBSD and other platforms where built-in
service installation is not supported yet.
 - Improved load-balancing algorithm, which should result in lower
latency.

* Version 2.0.1
 - Cached source data were not redownloaded if the proxy was used
without interruption. This has been fixed.
 - If the network is down at startup time, fall back to cached source
data, even if is it out of date, and schedule an immediate update
after the networks is back.
 - RTT estimation for DNS-over-HTTP/2 servers was off. This has been
fixed.
 - The generate-domains-blacklist script now has a configurable
timeout value, and can produce time-based rules.
 - The timeout parameter in the example configuration file didn't had
the correct name; this has been fixed.
 - Cache: TTLs are now decreasing.
