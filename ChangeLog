# Version 2.0.45
 - Configuration changes (to be required in versions 2.1.x):
   * `[blacklist]` has been renamed to `[blocked_names]`
   * `[ip_blacklist]` has been renamed to `[blocked_ips]`
   * `[whitelist]` has been renamed to `[allowed_names]`
   * `generate-domains-blacklist.py` has been renamed to
     `generate-domains-blocklist.py`, and the configuration files have been
     renamed as well.
 - `dnscrypt-proxy -resolve` has been completely revamped, and now requires
the configuration file to be accessible. It will send a query to an IP address
of the `dnscrypt-proxy` server by default. Sending queries to arbitrary
servers is also supported with the new `-resolve name,address` syntax.
 - Relay lists can be set to `*` for automatic relay selection. When a wildcard
is used, either for the list of servers or relays, the proxy ensures that
relays and servers are on distinct networks.
 - Lying resolvers are detected and reported.
 - New return code: `NOT_READY` for queries received before the proxy has
been initialized.
 - Server lists can't be older than a week any more, even if directory
permissions are incorrect and cache files cannot be written.
 - macOS/arm64 is now officially supported.
 - New feature: `allowed_ips`, to configure a set of IP addresses to
never block no matter what DNS name resolves to them.
 - Hard-coded IP addresses can be immediately returned for test queries
sent by operating systems in order to check for connectivity and captive
portals. Such responses can be sent even before an interface is considered
as enabled by the operating system. This can be configured in a new section
called `[captive_portals]`.
 - On Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD, `listen_addresses` can now include IP
addresses that haven't been assigned to an interface yet.
 - The logo has been tweaked to look fine on a dark background.
 - `generate-domains-blocklist.py`: regular expressions are now ignored in
time-based entries.
 - Minor bug fixes and logging improvements.
 - Cloaking plugin: if an entry has multiple IP addresses for a type,
all the IP addresses are now returned instead of a random one.
 - Static entries can now include DNSCrypt relays.
 - Name blocking: aliases relying on `SVCB` and `HTTPS` records can now
be blocked in addition to aliases via regular `CNAME` records.
 - EDNS-Client-Subnet information can be added to outgoing queries.
Instead of sending the actual client IP, ECS information is user
configurable, and IP addresses will be randomly chosen for every query.
 - Initial DoH queries are now checked using random names in order to
properly measure CDNs such as Tencent that ignore the padding.
 - DoH: the `max-stale` cache control directive is now present in queries.
 - Logs can now be sent to `/dev/stdout` instead of actual files.
 - User switching is now supported on macOS.
 - New download mirror (https://download.dnscrypt.net) for resolvers,
relays and parental-control.

# Version 2.0.44
 - More updates to the set of block lists, thanks again to IceCodeNew.
 - Netprobes and listening sockets are now ignored when the `-list`,
`-list-all`, `-show-certs` or `-check` command-line switches are used.
 - `tls_client_auth` was renamed to `doh_client_x509_auth`. A section
with the previous name is temporarily ignored if empty, but will error
out if not.
 - Unit tests are now working on 32-bit systems. Thanks to Will Elwood
and @lifenjoiner.

# Version 2.0.43
 - Built-in support for DNS64 translation has been implemented.
(Contributed by Sergey Smirnov, thanks!)
 - Connections to DoH servers can be authenticated using TLS client
certificates (Contributed by Kevin O'Sullivan, thanks!)
 - Multiple stamps are now allowed for a single server in resolvers
and relays lists.
 - Android: the time zone for log files is now set to the system
time zone.
 - Quite a lot of updates and additions have been made to the
example domain block lists. Thanks to `IceCodeNew`!
 - Cached configuration files can now be temporarily used if
they are out of date, but bootstraping is impossible. Contributed by
`lifenjoiner`, thanks!
 - Precompiled macOS binaries are now notarized.
 - `generate-domains-blacklists` now tries to deduplicate entries
clobbered by wildcard rules. Thanks to `Huhni`!
 - `generate-domains-blacklists` can now directly write lists to a
file with the `-o` command-line option.
 - cache files are now downloaded as the user the daemon will be running
as. This fixes permission issues at startup time.
 - Forwarded queries are now subject to global timeouts, and can be
forced to use TCP.
 - The `ct` parameter has been removed from DoH queries, as Google doesn't
require it any more.
 - Service installation is now supported on FreeBSD.
 - When stored into a file, service logs now only contain data from the most
recent launch. This can be changed with the new `log_file_latest` option.
 - Breaking change: the `tls_client_auth` section was renamed to
`doh_client_x509_auth`. If you had a tls_client_auth section in the
configuration file, it needs to be updated.

# Version 2.0.42
 - The current versions of the `dnsdist` load balancer (presumably used
by quad9, cleanbrowsing, qualityology, freetsa.org, ffmuc.net,
opennic-bongobow, sth-dnscrypt-se, ams-dnscrypt-nl and more)
is preventing queries over 1500 bytes from being received over UDP.
Temporary workarounds have been introduced to improve reliability
with these resolvers for regular DNSCrypt. Unfortunately, anonymized
DNS cannot be reliable until the issue is fixed server-side. `dnsdist`
authors are aware of it and are working on a fix.
 - New option in the `[anonymized_dns]` section: `skip_incompatible`,
to ignore resolvers incompatible with Anonymized DNS instead of
using them without a relay.
 - The server latency benchmark is faster while being able to perform
more retries if necessary.
 - Continuous integration has been moved to GitHub Actions.

# Version 2.0.41
 - Precompiled ARM binaries are compatible with ARMv5 CPUs. The
default arm builds were not compatible with older CPUs when compiled
with Go 1.14. mips64 binaries are explicitly compiled with `softfloat`
to improve compatibility.
 - Quad9 seems to be only blocking fragmented queries over UDP for
some networks. They have been removed from the default list of broken
resolvers; runtime detection of support for fragments should now do
the job.
 - Runtime detection of support for fragments was actually enabled.

# Version 2.0.40
 - Servers blocking fragmented queries are now automatically detected.
 - The server name is now only present in query logs when an actual
upstream servers was required to resolve a query.
 - TLS client authentication has been added for DoH.
 - The Firefox plugin is now skipped for connections coming from the
local DoH server.
 - DoH RTT computation is now more accurate, especially when CDNs are
in the middle.
 - The forwarding plugin is now more reliable, and handles retries over
 TCP.

# Version 2.0.39
 - The Firefox Local DoH service didn't properly work in version 2.0.38;
this has been fixed. Thanks to Simon Brand for the report!

# Version 2.0.38
 - Entries from lists (forwarding, blacklists, whitelists) now support
inline comments.
 - Reliability improvement: queries over UDP are retried after a timeout
instead of solely relying on the client.
 - Reliability improvement: during temporary network outages, cached records
are now served even if they are stale.
 - Bug fix: SOCKS proxies and DNS relays can be combined.
 - New feature: multiple fallback resolvers are now supported (see the
new `fallback_resolvers` option. Note that `fallback_resolver` is
still supported for backward compatibility).
 - Windows: the service can be installed with a configuration file
stored separately from the application.
 - Security (affecting DoH): precompiled binaries of dnscrypt-proxy 2.0.37 are
built using Go 1.13.7 that fixes a TLS certificate parsing issue present in
previous versions of the compiler.

# Version 2.0.36
 - New option: `block_undelegated`. When enabled, `dnscrypt-proxy` will
directly respond to queries for locally-served zones (https://sk.tl/2QqB971U)
and nonexistent zones that should have been kept local, but are frequently
leaked. This reduces latency and improves privacy.
 - Conformance: the `DO` bit is now set in synthetic responses if it was
set in a question, and the `AD` bit is cleared.
 - The `miegkg/dns` module was updated to version 1.1.26, that fixes a
security issue affecting non-encrypted/non-authenticated DNS traffic. In
`dnscrypt-proxy`, this only affects the forwarding feature.

# Version 2.0.35
 - New option: `block_unqualified` to block `A`/`AAAA` queries with
unqualified host names. These will very rarely get an answer from upstream
resolvers, but can leak private information to these, as well as to root
servers.
 - When a `CNAME` pointer is blocked, the original query name is now logged
along with the pointer. This makes it easier to know what the original
query name, so it can be whitelisted, or what the pointer was, so it
can be removed from the blacklist.

# Version 2.0.34
 - Blacklisted names are now also blocked if they appear in `CNAME`
pointers.
 - `dnscrypt-proxy` can now act as a local DoH *server*. Firefox can
be configured to use it, so that ESNI can be enabled without bypassing
your DNS proxy.

# Version 2.0.33
 - Fixes an issue that caused some valid queries to return `PARSE_ERROR`.

# Version 2.0.32
 - On certificate errors, the server name is now logged instead of the
provider name, which is generally more useful.
 - IP addresses for DoH servers that require DNS lookups are now cached
for at least 12 hours.
 - `ignore_system_dns` is now set to `true` by default.
 - A workaround for a bug in Cisco servers has been implemented.
 - A corrupted or incomplete resolvers list is now ignored, keeping the
last good known cached list until the next update. In addition, logging was
improved and unit tests were also added. Awesome contribution from William
Elwood, thanks!
 - On Windows, the network probe immediately returned instead of blocking
if `netprobe_timeout` was set to `-1`. This has been fixed.
 - Expired cached IP addresses now have a grace period, to avoid breaking the
service if they temporarily can't be refreshed.
 - On Windows, the service now returns immediately, solving a long-standing
issue when initialization took more than 30 seconds ("The service did not
respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion"). Fantastic
work by Alison Winters, thanks!
 - The `SERVER_ERROR` error code has been split into two new error codes:
`NETWORK_ERROR` (self-explanatory) and `SERVFAIL` (a response was returned,
but it includes a `SERVFAIL` error code).
 - Responses are now always compressed.

# Version 2.0.31
 - This version fixes two regressions introduced in version 2.0.29:
DoH server couldn't be reached over IPv6 any more, and the proxy
couldn't be interrupted while servers were being benchmarked.

# Version 2.0.30
 - This version fixes a startup issue introduced in version 2.0.29,
on systems for which the service cannot be automatically installed
(such as OpenBSD and FreeBSD). Reported by @5ch17 and Vinícius Zavam,
and fixed by Will Elwood, thanks!

# Version 2.0.29
 - Support for Anonymized DNS has been added!
 - Wait before stopping, fixing an issue with Unbound (thanks to
Vladimir Bauer)
 - DNS stamps are now included in the -list-all -json ouptut
 - The netprobe_timeout setting from the configuration file or
command-line was ignored. This has been fixed.
 - The TTL or cloaked entries can now be adjusted (thanks to Markus
Linnala)
 - Cached IP address from DoH servers now expire (thanks to Markus
Linnala)
 - DNSCrypt certificates can be fetched over Tor and SOCKS proxies
 - Retries over TCP are faster
 - Improved logging (thanks to Alison Winters)
 - Ignore non-TXT records in certificate responses (thanks to Vladimir
Bauer)
 - A lot of internal cleanups, thanks to Markus Linnala.

# Version 2.0.28
 - Invalid server entries are now skipped instead of preventing a
source from being used. Thanks to Alison Winters for the contribution!
 - Truncated responses are immediately retried over TCP instead of
waiting for the client to retry. This reduces the latency for large
responses.
 - Responses sent to the local network are assumed to support at least
1252 bytes packets, and use optional information from EDNS up to 4096
bytes. This also reduces latency.
 - Logging improvements: servers are not logged for cached, synthetic
and cloaked responses. And the forwarder is logged instead of the
regular server for forwarded responses.

# Version 2.0.27
 - The X25519 implementation was changed from using the Go standard
implementation to using Cloudflare's CIRCL library. Unfortunately,
CIRCL appears to be broken on big-endian systems. That change has been
reverted.
 - All the dependencies have been updated.

# Version 2.0.26
 - A new plugin was added to prevent Firefox from bypassing the system
DNS settings.
 - New configuration parameter to set how to respond to blocked
queries: `blocked_query_response`. Responses can now be empty record
sets, REFUSED response codes, or predefined IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.
 - The `refused_code_in_responses` and `blocked_query_response` options
have been folded into a new `blocked_query_response` option.
 - The fallback resolver is now accessed using TCP if `force_tcp` has
been set to `true`.
 - CPU usage when enabling DNSCrypt ephemeral keys has been reduced.
 - New command-line option: `-show-certs` to print DoH certificate
hashes.
 - Solaris packages are now provided.
 - DoH servers on a non-standard port, with stamps that don't include
IP addresses, and without working system resolvers can now be properly
bootstrapped.
 - A new option, `query_meta`, is now available to add optional records
to client queries.

# Version 2.0.25
 - The example IP address for network probes didn't work on Windows.
The example configuration file has been updated and the fallback
resolver IP is now used when no netprobe address has been configured.

# Version 2.0.24
 - The query log now includes the time it took to complete the
transaction, the name of the resolver that sent the response and if
the response was served from the cache. Thanks to Ferdinand Holzer for
his help!
 - The list of resolvers, sorted by latency, is now printed after all
the resolvers have been probed.
 - The "fastest" load-balancing strategy has been renamed to "first".
 - On Windows, a nul byte is sent to the netprobe address. This is
required to check for connectivity on this platform. Thanks to Mathias
Berchtold.
 - The Malwaredomainlist URL was updated to directly parse the host
list. Thanks to Encrypted.Town.
 - The Python script to generate lists of blacklisted domains is now
compatible both with Python 2 and Python 3. Thanks to Simon R.
 - A warning is now displayed for DoH is requested but the server
doesn't speak HTTP/2.
 - A crash with loaded-balanced sets of cloaked names was fixed.
Thanks to @inkblotadmirer for the report.
 - Resolvers are now tried in random order to avoid favoring the first
ones at startup.

# Version 2.0.23
 - Binaries for FreeBSD/armv7 are now available.
 - .onion servers are now automatically ignored if Tor routing is not
enabled.
 - Caching of server addresses has been improved, especially when
using proxies.
 - DNSCrypt communications are now automatically forced to using TCP
when a SOCKS proxy has been set up.

# Version 2.0.22
 - The previous version had issues with the .org TLD when used in
conjunction with dnsmasq. This has been fixed.

# Version 2.0.21
 - The change to run the Windows service as `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`
has been reverted, as it was reported to break logging (Windows only).

# Version 2.0.20
 - Startup is now *way* faster, especially when using DoH servers.
 - A new action: `CLOAK` is logged when queries are being cloaked.
 - A cloaking rule can now map to multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
with load-balancing.
 - New option: `refused_code_in_responses` to return (or not) a
`REFUSED` code on blacklisted queries. This is disabled by default, in
order to work around a bug in Android Pie.
 - Time-based restrictions are now properly handled in the
generate-domains-blacklist.py script.
 - Other improvements have been made to the `generate-domains-blacklist.py`
script.
 - The Windows service is now installed as `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`.

# Version 2.0.19
 - The value for `netprobe_timeout` was read from the command-line, but
not from the configuration file any more. This is a regression introduced
in the previous version, that has been fixed.
 - The default value for netprobe timeouts has been raised to 60 seconds.
 - A hash of the body is added to query parameters when sending DoH
queries with the POST method in order to work around badly configured
proxies.

# Version 2.0.18
 - Official builds now support TLS 1.3.
 - The timeout for the initial connectivity check can now be set from
the command line.
 - An `Accept:` header is now always sent with `GET` queries.
 - BOMs are now ignored in configuration files.
 - In addition to SOCKS, HTTP and HTTPS proxies are now supported for
DoH servers.

# Version 2.0.17
 - Go >= 1.11 is now supported
 - The flipside is that Windows XP is not supported any more :(
 - When dropping privileges, there is no supervisor process any more.
 - DNS options used to be cleared from DNS queries, with the exception
of flags and payload sizes. This is not the case any more.
 - DoH queries are smaller, since workarounds are not required any more
after Google updated their implementation.

# Version 2.0.16
 - On Unix-like systems, the server can run as an unprivileged user,
and the main process will automatically restart if an error occurs.
 - pledge() on OpenBSD.
 - New "offline" mode to serve queries locally without contacting any
upstream servers. This can be especially useful along with the
cloaking module for local development.
 - New logo.
 - TTL of OPT records is properly ignored by the caching module.
 - The proxy doesn't quit any more if new TCP connections cannot be
created.

# Version 2.0.15
 - Support for proxies (HTTP/SOCKS) was added. All it takes to route
all TCP queries to Tor is add `proxy = "socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"` to
the configuration file.
 - Querylog files have a new record indicating the outcome of each
transaction.
 - Pre-built binaries for Linux are statically linked on all
architectures.

# Version 2.0.14
 - Supports DNS-over-HTTPS draft 08.
 - Netprobes don't use port 0 by default, as this causes issues with
Little Snitch and FreeBSD.

# Version 2.0.13
 - This version fixes a crash when using DoH for queries whose size
were a multiple of the block size. Reported by @char101, thanks!

# Version 2.0.12
 - Further compatibility fixes for Alpine Linux/i386 and Android/i386
have been made. Thanks to @aead for his help!
 - The proxy will now wait for network connectivity before starting.
This is useful if the proxy is automatically started at boot, possibly
before the network is fully configured.
 - The IPv6 blocking module now returns synthetic SOA records to
improve compatibility with downstream resolvers and stub resolvers.

# Version 2.0.11
 - This release fixes a long-standing bug that caused the proxy to
block or crash when Position-Independent Executables were produced.
This bug only showed up when compiled on (not for) Alpine Linux and
Android, for some CPU architectures.
 - New configuration settings: cache_neg_min_ttl and
cache_neg_max_ttl, to clamp the negative caching TTL.

# Version 2.0.10
 - This version fixes a crash when an incomplete size is sent by a
local client for a query over TCP.
 - Slight performance improvement of DNSCrypt on non-Intel CPUs such
as Raspberry Pi.

# Version 2.0.9
 - Whitelists have been implemented: one a name matches a pattern in
the whitelist, rules from the name-based and IP-based blacklists will
be bypassed. Whitelists support the same patterns as blacklists, as
well as time-based rules, so that some website can be normally
blocked, but accessible on specific days or times of the day.
 - Lists are now faster to load, and large lists require significantly
less memory than before.
 - New options have been added to disable TLS session tickets as well
as use a specific cipher suite. See the example configuration file for
a recommended configuration to speed up DoH servers on ARM such as
Android devices and Raspberry Pi.
 - The `-service install` command now remembers what the current
directory was when the service was installed, in order to later load
configuration files with relative paths.
 - DoH: The "Cache-Control: max-age" header is now ignored.
 - Patterns can now be prefixed with `=` to do exact matching:
`=example.com` matches `example.com` but will not match `www.example.com`.
 - Patterns are now fully supported by the cloaking module.
 - A new option was added to use a specific cipher suite instead of
the server's provided one. Using RSA+ChaChaPoly over ECDSA+AES-GCM has
shown to decrease CPU usage and latency when connecting to Cloudflare,
especially on Mips and ARM systems.
 - The ephemeral keys mode of dnscrypt-proxy v1.x was reimplemented: this
creates a new unique key for every single query.

# Version 2.0.8
 - Multiple URLs can be defined for a source in order to improve
resiliency when servers are temporarily unreachable.
 - Connections over IPv6 will be preferred over IPv4 for DoH servers
when using a fallback resolver if `ipv6_servers` is set.
 - Improvements have been made to the example systemd configuration
files.
 - The chacha20 implementation was updated to possibly fix a bug on
Android/x86.
 - `generate-domains-blacklist.py` can now parse dnsmasq-style rules.
 - FreeBSD/arm builds have been added.
 - `dnscrypt-proxy -list -json` and `-list-all -json` now include the
remove servers names and IP addresses.

# Version 2.0.7
 - Bug fix: optional ports were not properly parsed with IPv6
addresses -- thanks to @bleeee for the report and fix.
 - Bug fix: truncate TCP queries to the prefixed length.
 - Certificates are force-refreshed after a time jump (e.g. when a
system resumes from hibernation).

# Version 2.0.6
 - Automatic log files rotation was finally implemented.
 - A new -pidfile command-line option to write the PID file was added.

# Version 2.0.5
 - Fixes a crash occasionally happening when using DoH servers, with
stamps not containing any IP addresses, a DNSSEC-signed name, a
non-working system DNS configuration, and a fallback server supporting
DNSSEC.

# Version 2.0.4
 - Fixes a regression with truncated packets. Thanks to @mazesy and
@the-w1nd for spotting a case triggering this!

# Version 2.0.3
 - Load balancing: resolvers that respond promptly, but with bogus
responses are now gradually removed from the preferred pool.
 - Due to popular request, Android binaries are now available! Thanks
to @sporif for his help on getting these built.
 - Binaries are built using Go 1.10-final.

# Version 2.0.2
 - Properly error out on FreeBSD and other platforms where built-in
service installation is not supported yet.
 - Improved load-balancing algorithm, which should result in lower
latency.

# Version 2.0.1
 - Cached source data were not redownloaded if the proxy was used
without interruption. This has been fixed.
 - If the network is down at startup time, fall back to cached source
data, even if is it out of date, and schedule an immediate update
after the networks is back.
 - RTT estimation for DNS-over-HTTP/2 servers was off. This has been
fixed.
 - The generate-domains-blacklist script now has a configurable
timeout value, and can produce time-based rules.
 - The timeout parameter in the example configuration file didn't had
the correct name; this has been fixed.
 - Cache: TTLs are now decreasing.
