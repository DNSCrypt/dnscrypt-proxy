## Always use TCP to connect to upstream servers.

## When http3 is true, always try HTTP/3 first for DoH servers.
## If the HTTP/3 connection fails, fallback to HTTP/2 and don't try

## servers that advertise support via the Alt-Svc header.
##
## WARNING: This setting is disabled by default because it will make

## This is primarily a workaround for server operators who haven't

## solution is to reach out to these operators and encourage them to
## fix their servers to correctly advertise HTTP/3 support.

## SOCKS proxy

## Tor doesn't support UDP, so set `force_tcp` to `true` as well. When passing

## Bootstrap resolvers
##
## These are normal, non-encrypted DNS resolvers, that will be only used
## for one-shot queries when retrieving the initial resolvers list and if
## the system DNS configuration doesn't work.
##
## No user queries will ever be leaked through these resolvers, and they will
## not be used after IP addresses of DoH resolvers have been found (if you are
## using DoH).
##
## They will never be used if lists have already been cached, and if the stamps
## of the configured servers already include IP addresses (which is the case for
## most of DoH servers, and for all DNSCrypt servers and relays).
##
## They will not be used if the configured system DNS works, or after the
## proxy already has at least one usable secure resolver.
##
## Resolvers supporting DNSSEC are recommended, and, if you are using
## DoH, bootstrap resolvers should ideally be operated by a different entity
## than the DoH servers you will be using, especially if you have IPv6 enabled.
##
## People in China may want to use 114.114.114.114:53 here.
## Other popular options include 8.8.8.8, 9.9.9.9 and 1.1.1.1.
##
## If more than one resolver is specified, they will be tried in sequence.
##
## TL;DR: put valid standard resolver addresses here. Your actual queries will
## not be sent there. If you're using DNSCrypt or Anonymized DNS and your
## lists are up to date, these resolvers will not even be used.

bootstrap_resolvers = ['9.9.9.11:53', '8.8.8.8:53']

## the resolvers list:
##
## - queries will be sent to dnscrypt-proxy itself, if it is already
##   running with active servers (*)
## - or else, queries will be sent to fallback servers
## - finally, if `ignore_system_dns` is `false`, queries will be sent
##   to the system DNS
##
## (*) this is incompatible with systemd sockets.
## `listen_addrs` must not be empty.

## and -1 to wait as much as possible.

## Address and port to try initializing a connection to, just to check
## if the network is up. It can be any address and any port, even if

## On Windows, a datagram with a single, nul byte will be sent, only

## Remote lists of available servers

##
## Refer to the documentation for URLs of public sources.
##
## A prefix can be prepended to server names in order to
## avoid collisions if different sources share the same for
## different servers. In that case, names listed in `server_names`
## must include the prefixes.
##
## If the `urls` property is missing, cache files and valid signatures
## must already be present. This doesn't prevent these cache files from
## expiring after `refresh_delay` hours.
## `refreshed_delay` must be in the [24..168] interval.
## The minimum delay of 24 hours (1 day) avoids unnecessary requests to servers.
## The maximum delay of 168 hours (1 week) ensures cache freshness.

[anonymized_dns]

## Routes are indirect ways to reach DNSCrypt servers.
##
## A route maps a server name ("server_name") to one or more relays that will be
## used to connect to that server.
##
## A relay can be specified as a DNS Stamp (either a relay stamp, or a
## DNSCrypt stamp) or a server name.
##
## The following example routes "example-server-1" via `anon-example-1` or `anon-example-2`,
## and "example-server-2" via the relay whose relay DNS stamp is
## "sdns://gRIxMzcuNzQuMjIzLjIzNDo0NDM".
##
## !!! THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES !!!
##
## Review the list of available relays from the "relays.md" file, and, for each
## server you want to use, define the relays you want connections to go through.
##
## Carefully choose relays and servers so that they are run by different entities.
##
## "server_name" can also be set to "*" to define a default route, for all servers:
## { server_name='*', via=['anon-example-1', 'anon-example-2'] }
##
## If a route is ["*"], the proxy automatically picks a relay on a distinct network.
## { server_name='*', via=['*'] } is also an option, but is likely to be suboptimal.
##
## Manual selection is always recommended over automatic selection, so that you can
## select (relay,server) pairs that work well and fit your own criteria (close by or
## in different countries, operated by different entities, on distinct ISPs...)

# routes = [
#    { server_name='example-server-1', via=['anon-example-1', 'anon-example-2'] },

[dns64]

## DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records.
## It is used with an IPv6/IPv4 translator to enable client-server
## communication between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server,
## without requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node,
## for the class of applications that work through NATs.
##
## There are two options to synthesize such records:
## Option 1: Using a set of static IPv6 prefixes;
## Option 2: By discovering the IPv6 prefix from DNS64-enabled resolver.
##
## If both options are configured - only static prefixes are used.
## (Ref. RFC6147, RFC6052, RFC7050)
##
## Do not enable unless you know what DNS64 is and why you need it, or else
## you won't be able to connect to anything at all.

## Static prefix(es) as Pref64::/n CIDRs

# prefix = ['64:ff9b::/96']

## DNS64-enabled resolver(s) to discover Pref64::/n CIDRs
## These resolvers are used to query for Well-Known IPv4-only Name (WKN) "ipv4only.arpa." to discover only.
## Set with your ISP's resolvers in case of custom prefixes (other than Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96).
## IMPORTANT: Default resolvers listed below support Well-Known Prefix 64:ff9b::/96 only.
