# Security Policy

quic-go still in development. This means that there may be problems in our protocols,
or there may be mistakes in our implementations.
We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue,
please bring it to our attention right away!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments -- for example, by exposing
a remote execution exploit -- please [**report privately**](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/new).
Please **DO NOT file a public issue**.

If the issue is an implementation weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or
something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly.

## Reporting a non security bug

For non-security bugs, please simply file a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/issues/new).
