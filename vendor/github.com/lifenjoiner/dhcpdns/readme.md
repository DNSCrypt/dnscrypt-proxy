`dhcpdns` is a golang package to get the DHCP DNS.

It helps programs to use the upstream DNS easily when your network changed.

## Usage and Demo

[cli](./cli) detects the DHCPv6/DHCPv4 DNS repeatedly.

Enter cli dir in CLI:
```
go build
cli
```

It will need root privileges on operating systems other than Windows.
