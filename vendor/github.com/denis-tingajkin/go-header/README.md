# go-header
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/denis-tingajkin/go-header/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/denis-tingajkin/go-header/actions)

Go source code linter providing checks for license headers.

## Installation

For installation you can simply use `go get`.

```bash
go get github.com/denis-tingajkin/go-header/cmd/go-header
```

## Configuration

To configuring `.go-header.yml` linter you simply need to fill the next fields:

```yaml
---
temaplte: # expects header template string.
tempalte-path: # expects path to file with license header string. 
values: # expects `const` or `regexp` node with values where values is a map string to string.
  const:
    key1: value1 # const value just checks equality. Note `key1` should be used in template string as {{ key1 }} or {{ KEY1 }}.
  regexp:
    key2: value2 # regexp value just checks regex match. The value should be a valid regexp pattern. Note `key2` should be used in template string as {{ key2 }} or {{ KEY2 }}.
```

Where `values` also can be used recursively. Example:

```yaml
values:
  const:
    key1: "value" 
  regexp:
    key2: "{{key1}} value1" # Reads as regex pattern "value value1"
```

## Bult-in values

- **YEAR** - Expects current year. Example header value: `2020`.  Example of template using: `{{YEAR}}` or `{{year}}`.
- **YEAR-RANGE** - Expects any valid year interval or current year. Example header value: `2020` or `2000-2020`. Example of template using: `{{year-range}}` or `{{YEAR-RANGE}}`.

## Execution

`go-header` linter expects file paths on input. If you want to run `go-header` only on diff files, then you can use this command:

```bash
go-header $(git diff --name-only | grep -E '.*\.go')
```

## Setup example

### Step 1

Create configuration file  `.go-header.yml` in the root of project.

```yaml
---
values:
  const:
    MY COMPANY: mycompany.com
template: |
  {{ MY COMPANY }}

### Step 2 
You are ready! Execute `go-header ${PATH_TO_FILES}` from the root of the project.
