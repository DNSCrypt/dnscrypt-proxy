THE TRACKER IS DEDICATED TO KEEPING TRACK OF *BUGS*,
preferably after they have been already discussed and confirmed to be reproducible.

FOR ASSISTANCE, PLEASE CLOSE THIS FORM AND USE THE DISCUSSIONS SECTION INSTEAD:
https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/discussions/categories/q-a

~~~

Reported bugs must reproducible in the context described in the "Context" section.

Installation and configuration issues are not bugs, but individual assistance request.

Context: the LATEST version of `dnscrypt-proxy` (precompiled binaries downloaded from this repository) is correctly installed and configured on your system, but something doesn't seem to produce the expected result.

If the bug is not trivial to reproduce on any platform, please include ALL the steps required to reliably duplicate it, on a vanilla, generic install of macOS, Windows, OpenBSD or Ubuntu Linux system, in their most current version.

If you don't have any clear understanding of the issue or can't enumerate the steps to reproduce it, open a discussion instead:
https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/discussions
