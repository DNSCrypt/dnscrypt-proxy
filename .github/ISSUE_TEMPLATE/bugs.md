## Please read before filling a bug report

This tracker is dedicated to tracking bugs, reproducible in the context described in the
"Context" section.

Installation and configuration issues are not bugs, but individual assistance request.
In order to ask for help, please use the discussions (Q&A) section instead:
https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/discussions/categories/q-a

Context: the LATEST version of `dnscrypt-proxy` (precompiled binaries downloaded from this
repository) is correctly installed and configured on your system, but something doesn't
seem to produce the expected result.

If the bug is not trivial to reproduce on any platform, please include ALL the steps required
to reliably duplicate it, on a vanilla, generic install of macOS, Windows, OpenBSD or Ubuntu Linux
system, in their most current version.

If you don't have any clear understanding of the issue or can't enumerate the steps to
reproduce it, open a discussion instead:
https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/discussions
