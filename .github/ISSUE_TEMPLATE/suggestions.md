Got an idea for improving dnscrypt-proxy? We'd love to hear it!

### Start with a discussion

The best way to propose a new feature is to start in [Discussions](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/discussions/) under the "Ideas" category. This lets us:

- Talk through the idea together
- Get feedback from other users
- Figure out the best approach

Once we've discussed and agreed on a direction, we can convert it into a tracked issue here.

This helps keep the issue tracker focused on work that's ready to be done.
