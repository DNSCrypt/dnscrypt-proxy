Context: the LATEST version of `dnscrypt-proxy` (precompiled binaries downloaded from this
repository) is correctly installed and configured on your system, but something doesn't
seem to produce the expected result.

This is the right place to report it! Thanks for finding and reporting what may indeed be a bug!

If the bug is not trivial to reproduce on any platform, please include ALL the steps required
to reliably duplicate it, on a vanilla, generic install of macOS, Windows, OpenBSD or Ubuntu Linux
system, in their most current version.
